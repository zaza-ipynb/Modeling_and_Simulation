# Modeling and Simulation
This repo contains example of modeling or simulating object based on physics by implement it in python


**freefallmotion.ipynb** is the implementation of free fall motion consist
of both numerical and analytical methods to compare.

**analytical_pm.ipynb** is the implementation of projectile motion using
analytical methods, the formula is common, and easy to understand because
it is basic formula from physics.

**projectilemotion.ipynb** is the implementation of projectile motion using
analytical methods and also numerical methods with constraint or condition
influence by air resistance, the formula is a little bit similar. But
added with air resistance influence, a development from **analytical_pm.ipynb**
